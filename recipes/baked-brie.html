    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I took this to my book club meeting and had rave reviews. 
        You have to like garlic and hot spices. It was so easy to make 
        I was worried it wouldn't taste good. Boy was I wrong!!! I used 
        crackers but I think sliced baguette would be better.</p>
    <p>Easy to prepare and quite yummy! I didn't have any red pepper jelly 
        so used another milder jelly and it was still excellent. Would be 
        even better if I'd followed the recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) wheel Brie cheese</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons red pepper jelly, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut Brie cheese round in half lengthwise, creating two thinner wheels. 
            Spread crushed garlic on cut surface of 1 half; top garlic layer with 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper jelly. 
            Place the other Brie cheese half on top of filling. Spread remaining 1 tablespoon red pepper jelly on top of 
            Brie cheese; place in a round casserole dish.</li>
    </ol>
