    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're serving immediately half the garlic powder because its very strong. 
        If serving the next day serve as is. When the egg mixture has time to sit, 
        the garlic flavor calms down a bit.</p>
    <p>Love, love, love. Tangy, pretty and easy. It's fun to experiment with other 
        versions but this one is the one that reminds me of the version I grew up with, 
        it's pure comfort food and the MOST popular item on the potluck table.</p>

        <li>6 hard-cooked eggs, halved</li>
